### In general, the stock market appears to have done very well in 2017.  Nearly all of the stocks recorded positive returns, with the exception of TERP.  DQ and SEDG had the largest positive returns by percentage, but they also had two of the smaller total trading volumes.  This could indicate that their performance could be more volatile in the future.

### The performance of the script was greatly sped up by not sorting through the entire dataset when identifying the ending value.  For comparison, the new script ran in .119 seconds compared to .742 seconds, for the 2017 data, and .121 vs. .702 seconds for the 2018 data.
